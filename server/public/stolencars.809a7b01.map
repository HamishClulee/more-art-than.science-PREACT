Zero personalities. Two dead eyes. One loud mouth.</p>\n\n            <p>How did we get to a place where playing hop scotch extended past kids on the playground to an apparently valid strategy for spending time?</p>\n\n            <p>If people are a reflection of the world around them, then is it weird that I'm currently surrounded by people who think the number of things gathered photographic evidence of/for(??) defines their value?</p>\n\n            <p>It feels like that's the only metric that rates, just volume. It's the budget brand, no frills version of experience. Sure, it doesn't taste great and it gives you gas occasionally, but it's cheap and they sell it everywhere. Good shit right?!?</p>\n\n            <p>Humans are approaching the point of no return like a dog approaches scraps dropped from the dinner table. With equal measures of guilt and pure joy. Dogs eh, like I know this is wrong but, man, I want that dirty chip!</p>\n\n            <p>The best advise. Always bring your towel. You never know when the sea level will jump and then you can get pictures of a relaxing afternoon swim for the gram. #fuckit #towel #seenoevil</p>\n\n            <p>All this friction is a real thing, its not just something that happens on the internet. Even if the current prevailing theory is wrong, the world is warmer, the animals aren't happy about lack of biodiversity at their parties, and most fish surveyed stated loneliness as the number one factor affecting their day to day happiness. The warning signs are all around us, but we are too busy running away from our selves to see it.</p>\n\n            <p>At a certain point, in the not too distant future those warning signs, won't be signs anymore. The fire danger indicator will actually be on fire. The slippery went wet sign will be only be half way visible above the water line. The stop sign will have disappeared, carried away by a tsunami.</p>\n\n            <p>Actually, to be fair, given the choice between acknowledging the problem, and then having to measure the size of the sacrifice it'll take to fix, and eating a burger on a beach some where, washed down by beer. I might take the chicken as well. The human condition right?</p>\n\n            <p>Are we past the point of caring? has the problem become so insurmountable that we passed the fuck it mark 15 minutes ago, and now we're just driving in stolen car with no motherfucken' lights on?</p>\n\n            <p>// insert witty commentary about paper straws and their ability to save the world, but how they are a pain in the ass when it takes me 85 minutes to consume a beverage #soggy</p>\n\n            <p>I actually don't think we're there yet. There as in proverbially screwed. There is still a ton of good stuff happening, and a lot of humans worth their salt knocking about. The answers are still within reach, but not without effort, like precious stones buried underneath the ground. Ground that is so readily trampled underneath the feet of frothy humans, whipped up in a fury of their own making. Its not worth the blisters to heft a pick and shovel (haha no socialist pun intended). Why dig a hole in the ground to find shiny rocks, when there's colored glasses every where on the surface?</p>\n\n            <p>Why? </p>\n\n            <p>Because those buried stones are ideas, abilities, innovation and creativity. You might find the ability to lead humans, or discover the will to commit to something, the inspiration for the next technological solution to one of the world's 99 problems. </p>\n\n            <p>Hidden under mountains of faux spiritualism and unreasonable expectations of what we are entitled to are gems in the colors of bravery, discipline and fortitude.</p>\n\n            <p>We live in the age of snake oil. We play the role of the fool to it's absolute fullest. This is our 40 pieces of silver moment, and we are all about those coins.</p>\n\n            <p>The most rewarding path will always be less travelled, hidden behind a thicket. Covered for a reason. Which, once time and energy is spent will reveal a tiny piece of the puzzle, a little pearl of wisdom, a single clue in a multi part treasure map.</p>\n\n            <p>All. That. Dope. Shit. Is. Hidden.</p>\n\n            <p>The question is why does it feel like people are becoming more and more likely to just follow the sign posts. Keep trampling the beaten path deeper and deeper and in our naivety, and driven by that sinking feeling that we aren't doing something worth while, instead of stopping and considering what to do next, we glorify our mistake, advertise it using words better suited to selling beauty products, and say fuck it, drive on.</p>\n\n            <p>I've seen both my mum and dad, and one of my grandparents on their deathbeds. You know what they cared about? The depth of their relationships, and the value of their lives. Mum and Gran died angry and confused, because they played too much pre-internet hop scotch. It was not an easy thing to watch their final days weeks and months. Dad died beautiful. He did everything he set out to do well, and just strolled through that door. What a boss. Gran kept saying, over and over, why did I spend so much time pushing people away. She was 84.</p>\n\n            <p>Bro, sis, do it now, not later. Be better, you do not want it to end like that, trust me.</p>\n\n            <p>So, say the things that no one wants to hear, do the things that feel wrong, make a shit load of mistakes, break some bones and earn some scars. Build a fucking dream. Build a fucking temple, we need some new ones which are actually relevant. Walk backwards around the earth six times. Be kind to each other.</p>\n\n            <p>Do it because the beaten track is already getting so deep that it's become a hazard to the local wildlife. Do it because, doing one thing really well will not only be more rewarding, but because you've only consumed a fraction of the resources you would have if you had done ten things. Do it because you'll remember the final feeling for the rest of your life, not forget it a week later.</p>\n\n            <p>Will this save the world? Probably not. I know one thing for sure though, paper straws and tote bags won't even touch the sides. We need to address the cause, we have an attitude problem. We choose electronics over experience, cars over compassion, fiction over family. We let powerful people set us on a dangerous course for collision with disaster, but more importantly, our selves. Consider that moment, we click that our iPhone and 35 likes on our photo won't stop our extinction. We need to harden up. We need to struggle. We need to learn to say no.</p>\n\n            <p>Move less and think more, talk more and advertise less. If you want to be happy. Be.</p>\n        </div>\n    }\n}\n\nexport default StolenCars"]}
