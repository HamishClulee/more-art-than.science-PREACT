It's like Douglas Adams said...<br /><br />\n                \"Flying is the art of throwing yourself at the ground and missing.\"<br /><br />\n                At a certain point in the game, the jarring experienced by being thrown from paddle to paddle just\n                becomes normal. Learning how to accept your fate as a pinball gracefully is a worthwhile experience\n                on its own.<br /><br />\n                I never deign to offer advise. At best I'm a cautionary tale. When life gave me lemons I rubbed the\n                juice into my eyes.<br /><br />\n                But somewhere in this plethora of noise and landslide of proud and tiny tragedies there lies a kind of\n                wisdom. Running around heavy armed with foot guns and scissors teaches a amazing level of foolhardiness.\n                We are all jolly green giants wandering the earth...&nbsp;<br /><br />\n                Anyway, I'm hanging with Garry, busy with normalising our adventures through the windshield.</p>\n                <p>This is ridiculously unfinished.
